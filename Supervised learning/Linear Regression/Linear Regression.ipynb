    "### Introduction <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"Introduction\"></a>\n",
    "In this section we focus on a straight-forward and classic statistical model, linear regreesion (LR). The main idea of linear regression is to use a linear predictor function whose unknown model parameters are estimated from the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "(Least squares) linear regreesion is a classic and old supervised model, back to 1800's, finding a good rough linear fit to a set of points was performed by [Legendre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrien-Marie_Legendre) (1805) and [Gauss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Friedrich_Gauss) (1809) for the prediction of planetary movement. \n",
    "\n",
    "Linear regreesion is widely used in most regression tasks, variance analysis, and dependence analysis, and it plays an important role in the subfield of machine learning. The linear regression algorithm is one of the fundamental supervised machine-learning algorithms due to its relative simplicity and well-known properties.\n"

    "* Best linear unbiased estimator. The least square estimator of linear regression model has great properties. By the [Gauss-Markov theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauss%E2%80%93Markov_theorem), the ordinary least squares (OLS) regression produces unbiased estimates that have the smallest variance of all possible linear estimators. This property is called BLUE (Best Linear Unbiased Estimator).\n",

    "* Computationally friendly. The modeling speed of linear regression is fast as it does not require complicated calculations and runs predictions fast when the amount of data is large.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Great interpretability of the output. The ability of linear regression to determine the relative influence of one or more predictor variables to the predicted value when the predictors are independent of each other is one of the key reasons of the popularity of linear regression. The model derived using this method can express the what change in the predictor variable causes what change in the predicted or target variable.\n",

    "\n",
    "* Independence of variables. Assumes that the predictor variables are not correlated which is rarely true. It is important to, therefore, remove multicollinearity (using dimensionality reduction techniques) because the technique assumes that there is no relationship among independent variables. In cases of high multicollinearity, two features that have high correlation will influence each other’s weight and result in an unreliable model.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Homoscedasticity. The linear regression model assumes that independent variables can represent all expectation and variance of dependent variable (so that $E[\\epsilon_i]=0$ and $Var[\\epsilon_i] = \\sigma^2$), which is always not true because in real world it's hard for people to find exactly all independent variables that affect the dependent variable.
